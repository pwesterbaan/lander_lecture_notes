  \section{9.4: Hypothesis Testing for Means}
  Similar to hypothesis testing for proportions, we have the following four steps:
  \vspace*{0.5\baselineskip}

  \noindent
  \fbox{\parbox{0.9875\linewidth}{
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{Hypothesize:} formulate your hypotheses
      \item \textbf{Check conditions:}
        \begin{itemize}
          \item \textbf{Random and Independent:} The sample must be randomly collected from the population, and observations are independent of each other.
          \item \textbf{Large Sample:} Either the population is Normal, \emph{or} the sample size is large ($n\geq 25$).
          \item \textbf{Large Population:} If the sample is collected without replacement, the population of size $N$ must be at least 10 times bigger than the sample: $N\geq 10 n$
%          \item \textbf{Independence:} Each observation or measurement must have no influence on any others.
        \end{itemize}
        If these conditions are met, we compute the test statistic for the One-Sample $t$-Test which follows a $t$-distribution with $n-1$ degrees of freedom:
          \[t=\frac{\overline{x}-\mu_0}{SE_{\textnormal{est}}}, \qquad \textnormal{where} \qquad SE_{\textnormal{est}}=\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\]
      \item \textbf{Compute:} Stating a significance level, compute the observed test statistic $t$ and/or $p$-value.
      \item \textbf{Interpret:} Decide whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.
    \end{enumerate}

    McDonald's advertises that its ice cream cones have a mean weight of 3.2 ounces. To test this, we find the weights of a sample of $5$ cones:
      \[4.2, 3.6, 3.9, 3.4, 3.3\]

    In the 2011-2012 academic year, the mean cost of attending two-year colleges in the United States was $\$3,831$. Has this increase over time? A random sample of 35 two-year colleges in 2014-2015 had a mean tuition of $\$4,173$, with a standard deviation of $\$2,590$.
