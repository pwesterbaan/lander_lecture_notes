  \section{6.5: Loans and Amortization}
  \begin{defn*}
    \textbf{Amortization} is the process of repaying a loan. 
%    The present value of an \emph{ordinary} annuity is given by
%      \[A_n=R\sbrkt{\dfrac{1-\parens{1+i}^{-n}}{i}}\]
    When we have a debt of $A_n$, with an interest rate of $i$ per period, amortized by $n$ equal periodic payments (at the end of each period), the size of each payment is
      \[R=A_n\sbrkt{\dfrac{i}{1-\parens{1+i}^{-n}}}\]
  \end{defn*}
  \begin{ex*}
    A company modernizes its production by buying a new piece of equipment for \$$200,000$. It makes a \$$50,000$ down payment and agrees to amortize the rest of the debt with quarterly payments over the next 10 years. If the interest on the debt is $12\%$, 
  \end{ex*}
  \begin{extasks}[after-item-skip=\stretch{1}](1)
    \task find the size of the quarterly payments
    \task find the total amount of the payments
    \task find the total amount of interest paid
  \end{extasks}
  \vspace*{\stretch{0.5}}

  \begin{ex*}
    For the following, calculate the regular payments
  \end{ex*}
  \begin{extasks}[after-item-skip=\stretch{1}](1)
    \task $\$100,000$ for $3$ years at $9\%$ compounded annually
    \task $\$30,000$ for $5$ years at $7\%$ compounded annually
  \end{extasks}
  \vspace*{\stretch{1}}
  \pagebreak

  \begin{extasks}[after-item-skip=\stretch{1}](1)
    \task $\$20,000$ for $1$ year at $9\%$ compounded quarterly
    \task $\$50,000$ for $2 \sfrac{1}{2}$ years at $9\%$ compounded semiannually
  \end{extasks}

  \begin{ex*}
    Chuckie and Angelica have \$$30,000$ for a down payment, and their budget can accommodate a monthly mortgage of \$$1,200$. What is the most expensive home they can buy if they borrow money for $30$ years at $7.8\%$ compounded monthly?
  \end{ex*}

  \begin{ex*}
    A loan of \$$10,000$ is to be amortized with 10 equal quarterly payments. If the interest rate is $6\%$ compounded quarterly, what is the periodic payment?
